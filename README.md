The closest entrance to campus is on Monseñor Carlos Casanueva, although you can also uise the entrance on Avenida Vicuña Mackenna, which is closest to the metro stop (San Joaquin).  


### Event format
There will be a day of public presentations which will be open to the public, and which feature two keynote talks and one roundtable discussion. 
There will also be a day of paper workshops open to registered participants only. During this day, previously circulated manuscipts will be actively discussed, and no presentation will take place. Participation during workshops will follow the “1 finger/ 2 finger format”: a single raised finger indicates to the moderator that the participant wishes to be added to the list to make a new contribution to the discussion, and two raised fingers indicate the participant wishes to make an urgent point related to what was just said. There will be a short social event for all registered participants.  

All talks and sessions will be held in English.
